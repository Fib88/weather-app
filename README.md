Going to create a weather app that fetches data from an api and display that data to the page.

#### update1:
Index js can be ignored. It's my first attempt at the project and I started over midway.
The current version uses script.js only.

#### update 2:
Currently trying to have the correct days display for the day of the week.
I'm pretty sure I could pass data between functions more efficiently than I'm doing now.
Due to time constraints its something I'll have to check later.

#### update 3:
Managed to display days of the week. Right now I'm styling out a simple layout in css.
I'll add error handling if I have time.
