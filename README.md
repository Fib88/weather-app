### note: To able to use this app you need your personal key. To get a key you need to make an account on https://openweathermap.org and generate a key.


Going to create a weather app that fetches data from an api and display that data to the page.

####update1:
Index js can be ignored. It's my first attempt at the project and I started over midway.
The current version uses script.js only.
